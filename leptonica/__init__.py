# The leptonica_functions_parser.py and leptonica_header_parser
# are used as stand alone programs to generate the
# leptonica_functions.py and leptonica_structures.py
# In case you want to hack around this code
# or need to update to a different version of Leptonica

# the Leptonica.py file just contains a small usage example
